# Store-Number-Entity-Extraction

This notebook contains thought processes and workflow about entity extraction. **Entity extraction** is similar to named entity recognition (we could call it a sub-topic of that), except that it takes the classification one step further, and actually predicts the outcome of the classification (if we ran the sentence: "A cat jumped over the dog in San Francisco." through an entity extraction model, then it would output something like (cat, animal), (dog, animal), (San Francisco, location)). 

I also introduce the spaCy NLP library, which has powerful, but easy-to-use models for specific NLP tasks like parts of speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more. I hope to add more to this repo and learn more tools to do more entity extraction. Please feel free to take a look at what's in this repository.
